## HF Considerations for ML and <br> ML Considerations for HF
-- Human-centered ML represents a looming societal need

-- ML deployment sometimes neglects design and systems thinking

-- ML mindset for data analysis might save us from the p-value ritual

-- ML and Human-centered tradeoffs in model development



## Increasing Centrality of Machine Learning in System Design|Human implications of increasingly powerful algorithms

```{r, out.width="33%"}

```



## Design Thinking and Systems Thinking for Machine Learning

-- Design thinking: Empathy and understanding for person-centered solutions

-- Systems thinking: 5 whys? 5 whats?

-- Sea-level and C-level support for success

## Machine Learning versus <br> Inferential Data Analysis{.bigger}

-- Linear regression and logistic regression as machine learning?

ML mindset| Traditional inferential mindset
-----|-----:
Prediction|Inference
Cross validation and prediction error|Hypothesis testing and p values
Practical significance|Statistical significance



## Types of Machine Learning
-- Supervised learning: Predicting a known output

-- Unsupervised learning: Identifying unknown patterns or clusters

-- Reinforcement learning: Learning through interactions with a system

## Supervised Learning: More than curve fitting?

## Essential Tradeoffs in ML Design|Variance-bias tradeoff of a model $\theta${.smaller}
$\Omega(\theta)=$ Model complexity, ideally small variance and good generalization

$L(\theta) =  \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\hat{y_i})^2 =$ Model error, ideally small bias and precise predictions

Objective function$(\theta) = \Omega(\theta) + L(\theta)$

```



## Essential Tradeoffs in ML Design| Human-centered tradeoffs
-- Different errors: Cost of a miss may differ than a cost of a false alarm

$L(\theta) =  \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\hat{y_i})^2$ Positive errors equally problematic as negative errors??
<br />
<br />

-- Trust depends on more than AUC (Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve): Hard hits don't compensate for easy misses

-- People might value understandable models more than precise models

$\Omega(\theta)$ Model complexity does not typically reflect perceived complexity 


## Essential Tradeoffs in ML Design| Hyperparameters

-- Hyperparameters are parameters of the ML algorithms that govern how they fit the data
-- Some hyperparameters allow a better model fit
-- Some hyperparameters allow a more robust model
-- Some hyperparameters allow for a more understandable model
