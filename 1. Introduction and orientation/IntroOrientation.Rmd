Sandve, G. K., Nekrutenko, A., Taylor, J., & Hovig, E. (2013). Ten simple rules for reproducible computational research. \textit{PLoS Computational Biology}, 9(10), 1-4. 

Rule 1: For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced (Run script in R)

Rule 2: Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps (Run script in R)

Rule 3: Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used (Run checkpoint())

Rule 4: Version Control All Scripts (Use GitHub through RStudio)

Rule 5: Record All Intermediate Results (Create code chunks in R Notebook with inputs and output files)

Rule 6: For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds (Run set.seed(42))

Rule 7: Always Store Raw Data behind Plots (Run script in R)

Rule 8: Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output (Use R Studio Project file)

Rule 9: Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results (Use R Notebook)

Rule 10: Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results (Use GitHub through RStudio)
