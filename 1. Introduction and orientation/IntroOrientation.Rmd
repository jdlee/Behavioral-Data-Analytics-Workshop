## Workshop Purpose{.smaller}
-- Show how Human Factors professionals can contribute to machine learning and <br /> how machine learning can contribute to Human Factors research and design

-- Discuss issues and demonstrate techniques

## Workshop Purpose: Promote replicable research{.build}
Sandve, G. K., Nekrutenko, A., Taylor, J., & Hovig, E. (2013). Ten simple rules for reproducible computational research. \textit{PLoS Computational Biology}, 9(10), 1-4. 

Rule 1: For every result, keep track of how it was produced (Run script in R)

Rule 2: Avoid manual data manipulation (Run script in R)

Rule 3: Archive the exact versions of all external programs used (Run checkpoint())

Rule 4: Version control all scripts (Use GitHub through RStudio)

Rule 5: Record all intermediate results (Create code chunks in R Notebook with inputs and output files)

Rule 6: For analyses that include randomness set random number seed (Run set.seed(42))

Rule 7: Always store raw data behind plots (Run script in R)

Rule 8: Generate hierarchical analysis output (Use R Studio Project file)

Rule 9: Connect textual statements to underlying results (Use R Notebook)
