## Machine Learning Techniques|Visualizing multidimensional data 

```{r umap_visualiztion, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache = TRUE, out.width="85%"}
set.seed(42)

wine.df = read_csv("winequality-red.csv")

wine.umap = wine.df %>% 
  select(-quality) %>% 
  umap()

umap.layout = wine.umap$layout # Extract the dimensions
colnames(umap.layout) = c("x", "y") 

wine_umap.df = cbind(wine.df, umap.layout)

ggplot(wine_umap.df, aes(x, y, colour = quality>5))+
  geom_point(size = .8)+
  labs(title = "Dimensions of wine quality reduced to two",
       x = "Dimension 1", y = "Dimension 2") +
